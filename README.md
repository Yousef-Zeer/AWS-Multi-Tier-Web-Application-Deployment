## Network – Amazon VPC

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) serves as the backbone of your cloud network. In this section, you'll set up a secure, isolated networking environment. Key actions include:

* VPC Creation: Build the primary structure for your network.
* Subnet Configuration: Set up public and private subnets to separate resources securely.
* Networking Elements: Work with components like DNS configurations and gateways.
